# MITRE-ATTACK-Navigator-Mitigation
One function that the ATT&amp;CK® Navigator is yet to support, is the integration of Mitigation information on a per Technique level. If scoring is to be based off the Mitigations that have been implemented, the user must manually research the Techniques displayed in the ATT&amp;CK® Navigator, manually assess if the suggested Mitigations are in place and the level of confidence. Then using this to generate a score before manually feeding this back to the ATT&amp;CK® Navigator to visualise coverage. The aim of this project is to introduce this functionality. In this Beta, a REST API will be constructed with a Web Front End
